🔍 Project Title:
Dynamic Deadlock Detection and Recovery: A Simulation-Based Analysis

🧠 Overview:
This project simulates a deadlock detection and recovery system for an operating system. It lets users input the current resource allocation, request matrices, and available resources, and then uses a Python backend to:
Detect deadlocks using an algorithm based on resource availability and requests.
Recover from deadlocks by terminating selected processes and releasing their resources.
The result is shown visually through a web interface built with Flask and enhanced with HTML/CSS.

⚙️ Key Features:
✅ 1. Input Interface:
Users enter:
Number of processes
Number of resources
Allocation matrix
Request matrix
Available resource vector

⚠️ 2. Deadlock Detection:
The backend checks if the system is in a safe state using a simulation of resource allocations.
If no safe sequence exists, it identifies deadlocked processes.

🛠️ 3. Deadlock Recovery:
The system chooses processes to terminate (typically the one using the most resources).
Freed resources are reused to try and complete remaining processes.
Logs every step of the recovery.

🌐 4. Flask-Based Web Output:
Displays results as:

✅ “Safe State” message if no deadlock.

⚠️ List of terminated processes if deadlock was found.

📝 Step-by-step recovery log.
Styled with a clean, responsive HTML/CSS frontend.

🧪 Technologies Used:
Python 3
Flask (backend web framework)
Jinja2 templating
HTML/CSS for UI
(Optional) You could expand it with JavaScript or animations.
